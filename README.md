# cs231n assignments implenmentation.
There are my implementation of assignments for Stanford CNN for visual Recognition course(cs231n). 
## what is cs231n about?
This course is one of the most popular course about deep learning which is instructed by Fei Fei Li's team at Stanford.I highly recommend this course for ones who are interested in implementing deep learning materials. Although the course is not so detailed in theoritical aspects of concepts but is much useful for programming all models from scratch.In assignment 1 and 2 students should use numpy and get familiar with vectorization and in assignment 3 they must use TF/Pytorch. For assignment3 I used Pytorch. In the following I go through all sections of each assignment.
